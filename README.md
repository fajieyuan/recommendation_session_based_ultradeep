We construct a large-scale session-based (sequential) recommendation dataset (denoted as Video-6M) by collecting the interactiton behaviors of nearly 6 million users in a week from a commercial recommender system. The dataset can be used to evaluate ulta deep recommendation models (up to 100 layers), such as NextItNet (as shown in our paper StackRecï¼ˆSIGIR2021)). If you use this dataset in your paper, you should cite our NextItNet and StackRec for publish permission.
